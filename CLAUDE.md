# Tech Stack

- Vite
- Pnpm
- React
- TypeScript
- ShadCN
- TailwindCSS
- TanStack

# Running application

- Run `pnpm dev` to start the application
- Run `pnpm build` to build the application
- Run `pnpm test` to run the tests
- Run `pnpm format` to format the code

# Architecture

- /src/api contains functions for interacting with the backend API.
- /src/components contains UI components.
- /src/pages contains pages for the application.

# Code Conventions

- Ensure type safety
- Avoid using any type
- Prefer interface over type
- Avoid comments
- Favour ShadCN components over custom components
- Create a new folder for each component
- Avoid hard coded positions for CSS

# Testing

- Components should be tested using unit tests
- Avoid useless tests
- Avoid using multiple asserts in a single test

# For AI

- Don't add anything not asked for from prompts without asking
- Use /design for design reference

# Code reviews

- This is a personal project so code does not have to be industry standard, but it should be readable and maintainable.
